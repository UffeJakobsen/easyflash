This document describes how to build MultiColor from source.

You can get the sources for the latest released version or a developer snapshot
here:

http://multicolor.berlios.de/

Linux and similar systems
=========================

1. install libwxgtk2.8-dev or whatever name it has on your system. This will
   hopefully also install all other dependencies like libwxbase2.8-dev

2. compile it (as normal user) using these commands:

   cd make/gcc-default
   make

3. install it (optional, as root) using this command:

   sudo make install

Step 3 should even create a menu entry for Gnome, KDE or Xfce.

Windows
=======

The official release for Windows is built on Linux using a cross compiler
This is done like described in the Linux section above, except that the
Makefile resides in make/win32-cross-mingw. It does also contain a target to
cross-build wxWidgets.

The source archive does also contain a project file for Visual Studio 2008.
To set up the environment and the wxWidgets library you should read this
first: http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B_Guide

When you managed to build the samples it should also be possible to build
MultiColor. It relies on the environment variable WXWIN to be set.

The project file may not be up-to-date. In this case simply remove all sources
which do not exist anymore and add all sources (*.cpp) which are missing in
the project.

Also other compilers may work, you can check this page if you want to know
more: http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Guides_%26_Tutorials

Mac OS X
========

Other platforms
===============

It may be possible to comile MultiColor on other platforms. The most important
precondition is that wxWidgets runs on that box. You can check it on following
page: http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Supported_Platforms

If you get it running somewhere else, I appreciate a report :)
